/// @description Insert description here
///An instance can be flagged as visible or not by setting this variable to true (visible) or false (invisible). This works by telling GameMaker: Studio to skip the draw event for this instance, so care must be taken when using this as it means that no code placed in the draw event will be run while the instance is not visible.
